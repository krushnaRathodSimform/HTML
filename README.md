# HTML 

> ## head
- The head HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets. There can be only one head element in an HTML document.

> ## meta
- The type of metadata provided by the meta element can be one of the following:
    - If the __name__ attribute is set, the meta element provides document-level metadata, applying to the whole page.
    - If the __http-equiv__ attribute is set, the meta element is a pragma directive, providing information equivalent to what can be given by a similarly-named HTTP header.
    - the __charset__ attribute is set, the meta element is a charset declaration, giving the character encoding in which the document is encoded.
    - If the __titmemprop__ attribute is set, the meta element provides user-defined metadata.

> ## semantic
- Semantic markup isn't just for making markup easier for developers to read; it's mostly important in helping automated tools decipher markup. Developer tools demonstrate how semantic elements provide machine-readable structure as well.
